    "It's very good that you use `try-except`. Although it is usually used for catching some specific exceptions, it can be used here as well. Another good practice is to add `else` and `finally`. Thus, `try` block allows us to handle some error. The `except` block catches the exceptions. `else` does something if there's no error. `finally` is to be executed in any case, whether there is an exception or not (it is useful when you definitely need to do something, for example, to close a file). \n",

The question about the dictionaries is based on the idea that 1. we don't need interchangeable columns in the dataset and 2. we should use numbers instead of str values when using some machine learning algorithms. Let's assume that we drop the **family_status** column after creating the dictionary, leaving only **family_status_id** in the dataset. Then we want to display the debt statistics. In order to make it clear we use dictionary to replace number with str value. That's all. So it's just a good example of using dicts for replacing values in the dataframe.
